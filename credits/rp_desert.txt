rp_cscdesert version 1.0
========================

This map is designed as a post-apocalyptic RP map set in the southwestern U.S. desert after
a global nuclear war. A small town has emerged on the surface from survivors, while pre-war
military installations still exist in the area. The valley was sealed off when the tunnels
leading out of the valley collapsed. If you have any questions, additions or requests,
