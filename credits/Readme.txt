---Description---

A large map set in an abandoned motel-like building.  This map should be good for 12-18 players
and includes gameplay inside and around the "motel".  The main hall on the ground floor is usually
the center of the action with its multiple entry/exit points, and vertical gameplay with the attic
above.  The map also includes a basement/laundry area accessible from the main floor or through a
sewer pipe from the small parking lot outside.  Have fun!

Changes since beta2 include:

Addition of soundscapes.
Cubemaps optimized.
Brushwork in basement optimized.
Water reflection bug in sewer fixed.
Water texture for sewer changed so GeForceFX owners can see reflections too.
