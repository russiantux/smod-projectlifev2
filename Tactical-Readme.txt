About
_______________________________________________________
SMOD Tactical is a modification of SMOD(Super Mod) for Half-Life2. This mod is meant for people who enjoy "realistic" military games like "Rainbow 6", "Operation Flash point", "Red Orchestra", "Infiltration, etc.

The CS:S Conversions of the Combine are by Tokotoko

Weapon models are community replacement models (see credits folder) or Valve Defaults

Enemy Sounds are from Battlefeild2

Script Mods and Configuration tweaks are by me, Phatcat.

Are you a bad enough Dude to play this mod?
_______________________________________________________
This mod can be pretty hardware intensive!

People having issues with crashes please try the following.

If you do not have a DirectX 9 card you need to run this file while in game.
"exec screeneffect_dx8"

You won't get all the great effects... but oh well.

If your game is too laggy try these two commands.
"exec performance_recomm"
"exec gore_hl2"

If you are getting bugged with how you keep running into corpses.
"exec ragdollcollide_reduce"


Common Errors
_______________________________________________________
   1. I can't get a weapon!?!
      kill someone, or type "exec draw" to get starter weapon, or... cheat and type "exec all_tactical"(cheater)

   2. I can't pick up or use old HL2 weaponsM
      Those guns are for pussies, so just forget about them

   3. I can't pick up a gun from my opponent, or any that I spawned (cheated) to get. You are a soldier, not a pack mule! You can carry the following

      1 pistol
      1 shotgun
      1 rifle
      1 smg
      1 heavy weapon

   4. I get these weird boxes when I use a scope.
      You don't have a DX9 card, or it's not working right. type "exec screeneffect_dx8".

   5. I get a Steam crash when I start!
      You do not have CS:S, HLDM, and HLLC installed
