mark009vn: for mat_fastspecular 0 to fix silver AK.
JMS.HappyCat: for pointing out a HUD error that I missed. you saved my butt there. (Hud is fine for me I hope it is for you as well)
The people of face punch: for showing errors that I missed. again you saved me.
planethalflife: For showing me how to use the HLLib.

The original people of Smod: tactical, with out you we would not have a mod this fun.
and last but not least, My old team Black list: with out you I would never have even dreamed of fixing this. (or doing what I'm about to do.)

If I missed you I am very sorry for the over site, but ive had a lot of people come to me saying the same things over and over.

In the imortal words of the original makers of smod. Happy hunting.
